# Love Calculator
## How it works
* Step 1. Take the letters of the word LOVES, and then find out how many of each letter are in both of the names.
* Step 2. place each of these numbers beside the other.
* Step 3. start adding each pair of numbers together, to generate the next number, you will continue to do this until there are only two numbers left.

For example. If the names where Duchess and Latro you would find, L=1 O=1 V=0 E=1 S=2. 11012 -> (1+1,1+0,0+1,1+2) -> 2113 -> 324 -> 56
